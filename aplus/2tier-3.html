    const questions = [
      {
        question: "A user reports that their Windows 11 system fails to boot with a 'CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED' BSOD. Event Viewer shows repeated errors from the 'svchost.exe' process. What is the most likely first step to troubleshoot this issue?",
        choices: ["Run 'sfc /scannow' to repair system files", "Boot into Safe Mode and disable non-essential services", "Reinstall Windows 11", "Update the BIOS firmware"],
        answer: "Boot into Safe Mode and disable non-essential services",
        explanation: "A 'CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED' BSOD related to 'svchost.exe' suggests a critical system service failure. Booting into Safe Mode loads minimal services, allowing you to disable non-essential services via 'msconfig' to isolate the problematic one."
      },
      {
        question: "A company’s Active Directory domain controller is experiencing slow logon times for users. You notice high CPU usage on the server. Using Performance Monitor, you identify the lsass.exe process as the culprit. What should you do next?",
        choices: ["Restart the server", "Run 'net stop lsass'", "Check for malware targeting lsass.exe", "Increase virtual memory allocation"],
        answer: "Check for malware targeting lsass.exe",
        explanation: "High CPU usage by lsass.exe, the Local Security Authority process, can indicate malware (e.g., credential theft). Scanning with Windows Defender or a third-party tool is the next step, as restarting or stopping lsass.exe could disrupt authentication."
      },
      {
        question: "A Windows 10 PC in a corporate network fails to connect to a shared printer. The error message indicates 'Access Denied.' The user is part of the correct security group. What should you check first?",
        choices: ["Printer driver version", "SMB protocol settings", "User’s NTFS permissions on the print server", "Firewall rules on the client PC"],
        answer: "Firewall rules on the client PC",
        explanation: "An 'Access Denied' error for a network printer often results from blocked SMB or print spooler traffic. Checking firewall rules on the client PC to ensure ports like 445 (SMB) are open is the first step before investigating permissions or drivers."
      },
      {
        question: "A user’s laptop running Windows 11 shows a 'No Bootable Device' error after a recent update. The BIOS detects the SSD, but the system cannot find the boot partition. What command in the Windows Recovery Environment should you use first?",

      },
      {
        question: "A Windows Server 2019 file server denies access to a shared folder despite correct NTFS permissions. The share permissions allow 'Everyone' full control. What should you verify next?",
        choices: ["SMB version compatibility", "User’s group policy settings", "File system encryption", "Network discovery settings"],
        answer: "SMB version compatibility",
        explanation: "If NTFS permissions are correct but access is denied, mismatched SMB versions (e.g., client using SMBv1, server requiring SMBv3) can cause issues. Verifying SMB settings via 'Get-SmbServerConfiguration' is the next step."
      },
      {
        question: "A Windows 11 PC fails to boot after a power outage, showing a 'BOOTMGR is missing' error. The disk is detected in BIOS. Which sequence of commands in the Windows Recovery Environment should you use?",

        answer: "Boot into Safe Mode and run a malware scan",
        explanation: "Pop-up ads and an unknown high-CPU process suggest a malware infection. Booting into Safe Mode minimizes malicious activity, allowing a malware scan with Windows Defender or a third-party tool to identify and remove the threat."
      },
      {
        question: "A Windows Server 2019 domain controller fails to authenticate users, and Event Viewer logs Kerberos errors with event ID 4768. What should you investigate first?",
        choices: ["DNS server configuration", "Firewall settings", "User account lockout policies", "System time synchronization"],
        answer: "System time synchronization",
        explanation: "Kerberos authentication relies on synchronized system time. A time drift greater than 5 minutes can cause event ID 4768 errors. Checking time sync with 'w32tm /query /status' is the first step."
      },
      {
        question: "A user reports that their Windows 11 laptop cannot connect to a corporate Wi-Fi network, but other networks work fine. The error indicates an invalid certificate. What is the most likely cause?",
