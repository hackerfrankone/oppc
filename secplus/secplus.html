      {
        question: "Which type of attack involves guessing passwords?",
        choices: ["Phishing", "Brute Force", "DDoS", "Man-in-the-Middle"],
        answer: "Brute Force",
        explanation: "A brute force attack involves systematically trying all possible combinations of passwords or encryption keys until the correct one is found. This attack exploits weak passwords or poorly protected systems, often using automated tools to guess credentials rapidly. It can be mitigated with strong password policies, account lockout mechanisms, and multi-factor authentication."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the primary purpose of a firewall?",
        choices: ["Increase network speed", "Block unauthorized traffic", "Manage user accounts", "Optimize memory"],
        answer: "Block unauthorized traffic",
        explanation: "A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. Its primary purpose is to block unauthorized access while allowing legitimate traffic, acting as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks."
      },
      {
        question: "Which protocol secures web traffic?",
        choices: ["HTTP", "HTTPS", "FTP", "SMTP"],
        answer: "HTTPS",
        explanation: "HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure web traffic, protecting data integrity and confidentiality during transmission. Unlike HTTP, which is unencrypted, HTTPS ensures that sensitive information like login credentials or payment details is safeguarded from interception."
      },
      {
        question: "What is a common symptom of a phishing attempt?",
        choices: ["Official-looking email", "Request for sensitive information", "Clear sender verification", "No attachments"],
        answer: "Request for sensitive information",
        explanation: "Phishing attempts often involve fraudulent emails or messages that trick users into providing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial details. These messages may mimic legitimate sources, urging users to act quickly, often through malicious links or forms."
      },
      {
        question: "Which encryption standard is considered obsolete?",
        choices: ["AES", "RSA", "WEP", "SHA-256"],
        answer: "WEP",

It guides the development of security policies and controls."
      },
      {
        question: "Which type of malware encrypts files for ransom?",
        choices: ["Trojan", "Ransomware", "Spyware", "Worm"],
        answer: "Ransomware",
        explanation: "Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files, rendering them inaccessible until a ransom is paid, typically in cryptocurrency. It often spreads through phishing emails or malicious downloads and can be mitigated with regular backups and robust security measures."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the purpose of a VPN?",
        choices: ["Increase bandwidth", "Encrypt and secure remote connections", "Optimize CPU usage", "Manage storage"],
        answer: "Encrypt and secure remote connections",

      },
      {
        question: "What is a zero-day exploit?",
        choices: ["A patch released on day zero", "An attack targeting unknown vulnerabilities", "A known security fix", "A routine software update"],
        answer: "An attack targeting unknown vulnerabilities",
        explanation: "A zero-day exploit targets vulnerabilities in software that are unknown to the vendor or unpatched at the time of the attack. These are dangerous because there is no immediate defense, requiring rapid response through patches or mitigation strategies once discovered."
      },
      {
        question: "Which authentication method uses a physical token?",
        choices: ["Password", "Biometrics", "Multi-factor Authentication", "Single Sign-On"],
        answer: "Multi-factor Authentication",
        explanation: "Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) requires multiple forms of verification, such as a password and a physical token (e.g., a smart card or authenticator device). This enhances security by combining something you know, have, or are, making unauthorized access more difficult."
      },
      {
        question: "What does DDoS stand for?",
        choices: ["Distributed Denial of Service", "Direct Data Operation System", "Dynamic Data Optimization Service", "Decentralized Defense Operating System"],
        answer: "Distributed Denial of Service",
        explanation: "A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack floods a target system or network with excessive traffic from multiple sources, overwhelming its resources and disrupting availability. It is often executed using botnets and can be mitigated with traffic filtering and load balancing."
      },
      {
        question: "Which tool is used to perform a penetration test?",
        choices: ["Wireshark", "Nmap", "Task Manager", "Disk Cleanup"],
        answer: "Nmap",
        explanation: "Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful tool used in penetration testing to scan networks, identify open ports, and detect vulnerabilities. It helps security professionals assess system weaknesses by mapping network configurations and services."

      {
        question: "Which protocol is used for secure file transfer?",
        choices: ["FTP", "SFTP", "TFTP", "HTTP"],
        answer: "SFTP",
        explanation: "SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) uses SSH to provide encrypted file transfers, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. Unlike FTP, which is unencrypted, SFTP protects sensitive data during transmission over networks."
      },
      {
        question: "What is a common vector for malware distribution?",
        choices: ["Email attachments", "Official software updates", "Verified websites", "System logs"],
        answer: "Email attachments",
        explanation: "Email attachments are a common vector for malware distribution, often delivered through phishing emails. Malicious files, such as infected PDFs or executables, can install malware when opened, emphasizing the need for email filtering and user awareness."
      },
      {
        question: "Which security control prevents unauthorized physical access?",
        choices: ["Firewall", "Mantrap", "IDS", "Encryption"],
        answer: "Mantrap",
        explanation: "A mantrap is a physical security control that uses two sets of doors to restrict access, ensuring only authorized individuals can enter a secure area. It prevents tailgating and enhances physical security in high-risk environments."
      },
      {
        question: "What does PKI stand for?",
        choices: ["Public Key Infrastructure", "Private Key Interface", "Packet Key Integration", "Public Knowledge Index"],
