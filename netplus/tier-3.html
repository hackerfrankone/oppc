        choices: ["Network congestion", "Misconfigured security group", "Incorrect DNS settings", "Faulty NIC"],
        answer: "Network congestion",
        explanation: "High latency on a specific hop in a traceroute often indicates network congestion, where traffic exceeds the link’s capacity, causing delays. This is common in cloud environments with shared resources."
      },
      {
        question: "A company is deploying a hybrid cloud network. Which protocol ensures secure communication between on-premises and cloud resources?",
